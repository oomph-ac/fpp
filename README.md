# Fair Play Policy
At Oomph, we are committed to fostering a fair and enjoyable gaming environment on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition servers. To support this goal, we reserve the right to record **all** player gameplay for future analysis at our discretion.

By participating on an Oomph server, you agree to uphold a fair and legitimate experience for everyone. You will not:
* Use modified proxies to gain an unfair advantage.
* Utilize programs or hardware devices with the intent to gain an unfair advantage.
* Promote clients designed to disrupt gameplay for legitimate players.
* Attempt to evade Oomph global punishments (if applicable to the server).
*Suspecting* another player of cheating is not an excuse to do so yourself. Violations will result in appropriate penalties.

This Fair Play Policy applies at the discretion of per-server administration and may vary based on specific scenarios (e.g., engaging with PvP bots). It is your responsibility to check or inquire about any exceptions. This policy may be updated without prior notice.

If Oomph identifies or suspects cheating, in collaboration with the server's administrative team, we reserve the right to impose a permanent ban on your account (and any associated accounts) from all servers using the Oomph proxy. Additionally, we may publicly identify you as a cheater at our discretion.
